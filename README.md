Yes, I think my attention span increased over the three days.The first day was not as successful as I expected. This was the day I realized how difficult it is to pay attention and control our mind on one single aspect at once. Throughout the half an hour of the first day, I struggled a lot even to control my mind and stay focused for ten seconds. I could remember very few points from the news broadcast of the first-day activity, as the entire day was a struggle between keeping my mind calm and focused. To make this event a success and to get the maximum advantage out of this activity, I conducted some research on how I could improve my active listening skills. On the first day, I found out that greater comprehension should result from active listening, which calls for much more intense focus and empathy. Further, I found out that it is listening intently to what is being said to show complete acceptance and unbiased evaluation.

On the second day, with the pre-research I did, I trained to be more productive with my activity. Unlike the first day, I was able to pay attention and gather important information on the news broadcast. But it was not easy to stay focused for more than 5 minutes on the second day. However, on my 1st day of research, I was able to improve my listening skills to some extent. On the third day, I was able to stay focused for nearly 8 minutes and it was a great improvement compared to my first day. The fourth day was far more successful than the 3rd day and on the fifth day, I was able to improve further and stay focused for nearly 10 minutes.So, I noticed my attention span increased over the first 3 days.

Yes, I saw a good improvement after 5 days.In addition, I realized that there is a strong connection between mindfulness and active listening. Refraining from judgments, having a calm and quiet environment, staying focused, and training my mind to stay focused are a few practical actions I can take to improve my listening skills. Practice is of utmost importance in active listening. Controlling my mind is not as easy as I thought but a greater understanding of how to do it will make this a success. When it came to the fourth day and fifth day, I had good practice and when my mind wanders, I always practiced putting a checkmark and refocused. This was a great way of controlling my mind.

When summarizing the findings, the vital aspect of attentive listening was practice. Practice can help us improve our active listening skills. On the other hand, the environment helps us a lot in active listening. Any obstacles such as disturbing atmosphere, hearing difficulties, and noises need to be eliminated when expecting better results. Further, it depends on our physical health and strength as well. When we feel bored, tired, and unhealthy, we will not be able to stay focused for a longer period.
           Mindfulness has a great role to play when it comes to attentive listening. The ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we are doing, and not unduly reactive or overwhelmed by what is happening around us is known as mindfulness. Awakening to the inner workings of our mental, emotional, and bodily processes is the aim of mindfulness. Mindfulness is also an aspect that should be trained and practiced.
           The third most important aspect is taking note of the important points. This practice will help us to memorize the important points. In addition, reminding our mind when it wanders is another practice that we can use to improve our attentive listening skills.
          
 Finally, this activity made me understand the importance of attentive listening and I will use this as a successful tool when developing myself.
